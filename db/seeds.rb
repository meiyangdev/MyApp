# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# test = Invoice.create
# test.id #=> 1
# test.invoices_id #=> "INV00001"

# test2 = Invoice.create
# test2.id #=> 2
# test2.invoices_id #=> "INV00002"
